# Titanic

Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic
shipwreck.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/uhjfh/Titanic
2. Navigate to the project directory: Titanic_Survival_prediction.ipynb
3. Install python-3.12.2-amd64.exe
   pip install '+++':
5. Install pandas
6. Install seaborn
7. Install sklearn
8. Install matplotlib

## Usage

This example demonstrates how to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict survival on the Titanic dataset. It loads the dataset, preprocesses it by selecting relevant features and handling missing values, converts categorical variables to numerical, splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the SVM classifier, predicts survival on the test set, and evaluates the model's accuracy.
